# Organize DITA Content

This script relocates your DITA content (or any other type of files) into the appropriate folders based on their filetypes. The script creates the folders if they are not existing. The script picks up and saves:

- Files with extensions *.dita* and *.xml* in folder **DITA**
- Files with extensions *.ditamap* in folder **DITAMAP**
- Files with extensions *.jpg*,*.jpeg*, and *.png* in folder **ARTWORK**
- Files with extensions *.SNAG*,*.ai* in folder **LOC_SOURCE**
- Files with any other extension in folder **MISC**

To run:
1. Make changes to the file extensions and directory names, as required.
2. Save the script in the same folder that you want to organize.
3. Run.
